We'd love to get your contributions to the project.  The standard github workflow is to fork the drake repository into your own github account, push your changes into a branch on that account, then (when your code is definitely ready) open a `pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/>`_ via the github website.  Your code will undergo a code review and will run the unit and regression tests on a number of build servers.  You can run those tests locally by running `make test` from the command line -- note that there are a lot of computationally demanding tests and this could run for a few hours depending on your machine.
